## Features

### Core Functionality
1. **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks to the To-Do section using the input field and the "Add Task" button or by pressing the Enter key.
2. **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Clicking on a checkbox moves the task to the Completed section with a smooth animation, and the checkbox disappears.
3. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Users can drag tasks freely between the To-Do and Completed sections. Tasks moved back to the To-Do section will have their checkboxes reappear.

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations provide visual feedback for interactions like marking tasks as complete or dragging and dropping tasks.
- **Modern Styling**: The application uses a clean, modern design adhering to UX best practices.
